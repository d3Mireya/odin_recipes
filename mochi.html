    <p>Mochi is a Japanese rice cake with a squishy and chewy texture. The filling, usually is sticky and mostly sweet.</p>
    <p><b>Ingredients:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Rice flour (mochigome)</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Sweet red soy bean filling (called adzuki bean paste or anko)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Cooking time</b></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Wrap red bean paste in foil and freeze until solid. Once the paste is frozen, divide and roll into eight equal balls. Set aside or return to the freezer.</li>
        <li>Mix sweet rice flour and green tea powder in a microwave-safe bowl. Stir in water, then stir in the sugar. Mix until smooth. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and cook in the microwave for about 3 minutes and 30 seconds. Stir the mixture, then heat in the microwave for an additional 15-30 seconds.</li>
        <li> Dust your work surface with cornstarch. Roll the (still hot) dough into balls. Flatten each ball and place one frozen red bean paste ball in the center. Pinch the mochi over the paste until covered. Sprinkle with more cornstarch and place the mochi (seam side down) in a paper muffin liner.</li>
        <li>Repeat the steps until all the dough and frozen paste is used.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Fresh mochi <i><b>should</b></i> be stored in the freezer. Avoid storing it in the fridge, as it will quickly dry out and harden. Store mochi in an airtight container in the freezer for up to two weeks. To prevent sticking, either flash freeze the mochi before transferring it to the storage container or individually wrap each mochi ball.</p>
    <p>Mochis, as most food taste amazing after they have been made. But can still be enjoyed them after 2 or 3 days refrigerated.</p>
